## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

- `.dockerignore` should exclude heavy folders like `/temp/`, `/fonts/`, `/har_and_cookies/`, `.vscode/`, and `__pycache__/`.
- Docker Compose automatically mounts `temp/` dynamically without bloating the image.

**Build the Image:**

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**Run the Container:**

```bash
docker-compose up
```

**Stop the Container:**

```bash
docker-compose down
```

- TikTok/Instagram Reels optimization (more emojis, faster cuts)
- Twitter optimization (square format option for previews)
- Platform-specific hashtag usage
- Cross-promoting live Twitch status in video text

---

## üöß Future Extensions

- GPU acceleration for Whisper
- Humor classifier for highlight ranking
- Instagram Reels and Facebook Stories automation
- Auto-generated custom thumbnails
- Twitch Clip Leaderboard integration
- Dynamic hashtag selection based on clip content

## üß† Agent Interaction & Progress Tracking

**Agent Must:**

- Always ask: "Which step (1‚Äì7) are we currently working on?"
- Summarize the goal for the chosen step.
- List all available methods with pros/cons and recommend the best based on automation, scalability, and quality prior to generating code for each step
- Document ALL changes made for each step,the files modified, and the rational behind the changes in the READMEBUILD.md file and comments in the code generated, if the code is alreayd generated add comments to explain what step the code is a part of and what its for. Through this process, the agent will be able to track progress and make informed decisions about the project's direction
- Wait for user approval before generating code.
- Be aware if the code generated is not working and actively bug fix with the user. The more proactive the agent is in fixing bugs, the more likely the user will be to trust the agent and continue with approvals.
- After each step, update README Entry Template

  ### Step: [Step Name]

  - **Status:** completed/pending/failed
  - **Files Modified:** file1.py, file2.py
  - **Rationale:** <Why this change was made, what it accomplishes>
  - **Prompt Used:** (The exact prompt you used to generate the code)
  - **Timestamp:** ISO timestamp (progress, decisions, prompt) and `progress.json`.

Example `progress.json`:

```json
{
  "Ingest VOD": {
    "status": "completed",
    "details": "Downloaded VOD and chat. No issues."
  },
  "Highlight Detection": {
    "status": "pending",
    "details": "Highlights generated. Awaiting user rating and approval."
  }
}
```

---

## üß© Step-by-Step Workflow (with Checklists & Success Criteria)

### Step 1: ‚¨áÔ∏è Ingest VOD

- [ ] Download Twitch VOD and Chat Log.
- ‚úÖ Success if `vod.mp4` and `chat.json` exist.

### Step 2: üö® Highlight Detection (Automated)

## Step 2: Highlight Detection

## This function analyzes chat and audio to detect highlights in Twitch VODs

- [ ] Detect highlights from chat and audio spikes.
- ‚úÖ Success if highlights JSON created.
- üöë Retry if 0 highlights.
- [ ] **Highlight Approval:**
  - Agent must present detected highlights.
  - User rates highlight quality (1‚Äì5 stars).
  - User must approve before proceeding to slicing.
  - If user disapproves, agent must retry or refine detection methods.
- After approval, present multiple video edit style options:
  - Fast-paced energetic cut (TikTok vibe)
  - Cinematic build-up and payoff (YouTube Shorts)
  - Meme/overlay explosion (meme culture targeting Instagram/Twitter)
- Recommend the best style based on detected highlight tone and audience engagement goals.
- Provide pros/cons of each editing style.

### Step 3: ‚úÇÔ∏è Slice Highlights into Clips

- [ ] Slice based on timestamps.
- ‚úÖ Success if clips saved.

### Step 4: üìù Subtitles Generation & Overlay

- [ ] Generate and overlay subtitles.
- ‚úÖ Success if subtitle-enhanced clips created.

### Step 5: üìê Format Clips for Shorts

| Platform         | Format Instructions                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| YouTube Shorts   | 9:16, 1080x1920, fast-paced first 3 seconds |
| TikTok / Instagram | 9:16, 1080x1920, text-heavy, emoji overlays |
| Facebook Reels   | 4:5 or 9:16, slightly longer intros         |
| Twitter Video    | 1:1 or 9:16, punchy, humor hooks first      |

Each format may slightly alter cut timing, caption size, or added visual effects.

### Step 6: üöÄ Automate Platform Uploads

- [ ] Upload to YouTube and TikTok.
- ‚úÖ Success if video appears published.

### Step 7: üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling & Logging

- [ ] Log events, retry on errors.
- [ ] Alert via Discord webhook if critical failure.

## üß† Focused Copilot/Agent Prompts

You are helping me build a full Twitch-to-Shorts automation tool in Python. I have a multi-step plan.

For each step, before writing any code:

- Ask me **"Which step are we currently working on?"** (I will answer with a number 1-7 from the README.)
- Once I answer, **briefly summarize what the goal is for that step** to confirm understanding.
- If there are multiple options for how to approach the step, **list all options with pros/cons and your recommendation** based on my project goals (automation, speed, quality).
- Wait for me to pick or approve an option before proceeding.
- After approval, **generate fully detailed, production-quality Python code** for that step.
- Add **inline comments explaining complex sections** of the code clearly.
- **After generating each step's code**, ask me: "Would you like to proceed to the next step or refine this one?"

Repeat this pattern for all steps until the project is fully completed.

Important:

- Always use open-source libraries unless I explicitly request something else.
- Always prioritize Windows compatibility (assume I'm running this on a Windows 11 system).
- Ensure that every script is **modular**, **reusable**, and supports **scalability** (batch processing of multiple VODs if needed).

Start by asking me **"Which step are we currently working on?"**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Commands & Code Snippets

### VOD Download

```bash
vodbot download <VOD_URL>
# Fallback method (Streamlink/yt-dlp):
streamlink "twitch.tv/username/vod_id" best -o vod.ts
yt-dlp "<vod_url>"
# Download chat logs (if not using VodBot):
twitch-chat-downloader <VOD_URL> -o chat.json
```

### Highlight Detection

- Analyze chat JSON for spikes/emote bursts (pandas, numpy)
- Detect audio peaks using FFmpeg/PyDub:

```bash
ffmpeg -i vod.mp4 -af "silencedetect=noise=-30dB:d=0.5" -f null -
```

- Optional: Face filter detection (OpenCV)
- Output highlights timestamps to JSON:

```json
{
  "highlights": [
    {"start": "00:45:10", "end": "00:45:40", "type": "humor"},
    {"start": "01:10:05", "end": "01:10:20", "type": "epic"}
  ]
}
```

### Slicing Clips

```bash
vodbot slice <VOD_ID> --start 00:45:10 --end 00:45:40 --title "Funny Moment"
# Or use FFmpeg batch slicing:
ffmpeg -ss 00:45:10 -to 00:45:40 -i vod.mp4 -c copy funny_clip.mp4
```

### Subtitles Generation & Overlay

```bash
auto_subtitle funny_clip.mp4 -o subtitled_clips/
```

- Add special effects/emojis if humor detected (MoviePy/FFmpeg overlays):

```python
# MoviePy example (pseudo-code)
clip = VideoFileClip('funny_clip.mp4')
txt_clip = TextClip("üòÇ", fontsize=50, color='white').set_pos('center').set_duration(5)
final_clip = CompositeVideoClip([clip, txt_clip])
final_clip.write_videofile('enhanced_funny_clip.mp4')
```

### Platform Uploads

```bash
vodbot upload <clip_id> --to youtube
# OR
youtube-upload --title="Funny Moment" --privacy="public" final_short.mp4
# TikTok upload via CLI:
tiktok-uploader -v final_short.mp4 -d "Epic moment üòÇ #gaming" -c cookies.txt
```

### Error Handling & Logging

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='automation_log.log', level=logging.INFO)

try:
    # critical operations (e.g., upload)
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error: {e}")
    # retry logic or notification here
```
